# OB-new
This directory includes coordinate generation scripts, SDFs generated by this work and logs

## Contents
- `Dockerfiles`: Environment for generating `platinum-ob-new.sdf`. Change branch name for other SDFs.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for coordinate generation
- `convert-ob.cpp`: Coordinate generation program. Edit this for different MMFF levels.
- `convert.sh`: Coordinate generation script for `platinum-ob-new.sdf`. Run this to generate SDF.
- `platinum-ob-new.sdf`: Main result of final implementation (branch: [fragment-based-builder-cod](https://github.com/n-yoshikawa/openbabel/tree/fragment-based-builder-cod))
- `platinum-ob-new-*.sdf`: Results in diffenrent MMFF levels. (branch: [fragment-based-builder-cod](https://github.com/n-yoshikawa/openbabel/tree/fragment-based-builder-cod))
- `platinum-ob-new-full-*.sdf`: Result using full dataset. (branch: [fragment-based-builder-update](https://github.com/n-yoshikawa/openbabel/tree/fragment-based-builder-before-ring))
- `platinum-ob-new-before-ring.sdf`: Result of matching generic rings **before** rigid fragments version (branch: [fragment-based-builder-before-ring](https://github.com/n-yoshikawa/openbabel/tree/fragment-based-builder-before-ring))
- `platinum-ob-new-no-ring.sdf`: Result of no generic rings version (branch: [fragment-based-builder-no-ring](https://github.com/n-yoshikawa/openbabel/tree/fragment-based-builder-no-ring))
- `platinum-ob-new-no-toc.sdf`: Result of no table of contents file version (branch: [fragment-based-builder-cod-no-toc](https://github.com/n-yoshikawa/openbabel/tree/fragment-based-builder-cod-no-toc))
